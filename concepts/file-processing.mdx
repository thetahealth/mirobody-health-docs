## Overview

Mirobody Health can process various types of health-related files, automatically extracting health indicators and making them available for AI analysis. This allows you to upload lab reports, medical records, and other health documents to build a comprehensive health history.

## Supported File Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="PDF Documents" icon="file-pdf">
    Lab reports, medical records, prescriptions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Images" icon="image">

</CardGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Your Files">
    Upload health documents through the web interface or API. Files are securely stored and encrypted.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatic Processing">
    The system automatically:
    - Recognizes file type and content
    - Extracts text and data from documents
    - Identifies health indicators (lab results, vital signs, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Health Indicator Extraction">
    LLM analyzes your documents to extract:
    - Lab test results (blood work, metabolic panels, etc.)
    - Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, weight, etc.)
    - Medical measurements and observations
    - Test dates and reference ranges
  </Step>

  <Step title="Query and Analyze">
    Once processed, you can:
    - Ask questions about your health data
    - Track indicators over time
    - Generate health summaries and reports
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Extracted Health Indicators

The system can automatically extract various types of health data:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Laboratory Tests" icon="flask">
    - **Complete Blood Count**: WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin, Platelets
    - **Metabolic Panel**: Glucose, Liver enzymes, Kidney function
    - **Lipid Panel**: Cholesterol, Triglycerides, HDL, LDL
    - **Thyroid Function**: TSH, T3, T4
    - **Tumor Markers**: Various cancer screening markers
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Physical Measurements" icon="ruler">
    - Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic)
    - Heart rate and pulse
    - Weight and BMI
    - Height
    - Temperature
    - Oxygen saturation (SpO2)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Device Data" icon="watch">
    When combined with connected devices:
    - Activity and exercise data
    - Sleep patterns
    - Heart rate variability
    - Daily step counts
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## File Upload

### Via Web Interface

1. Log in to your Mirobody Health instance
2. Navigate to the chat interface
3. Click the file upload button
4. Select your health documents
5. Add optional notes about the files
6. Upload and wait for processing to complete

### Via API

For developers integrating file upload:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18080/files/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "files=@lab_report.pdf"
```

<Info>
For detailed API documentation and WebSocket upload with progress tracking, see the [File Processing Implementation Guide](/development/file-processing).
</Info>

## Configuration

Enable health indicator extraction in `config.yaml`:

```yaml config.yaml
# File Processing Configuration
ENABLE_INDICATOR_EXTRACTION: 1  # Enable automatic indicator extraction

# Required for file processing
GOOGLE_API_KEY: 'your_google_api_key'  # Gemini for multimodal processing
```

<Warning>
**GOOGLE_API_KEY is required** for processing files. Without it, file upload will work but automatic indicator extraction and content analysis will not function.
</Warning>

## Privacy & Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data Encryption" icon="lock">
    - All uploaded files are encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
    - Files stored in object storage with encryption
    - Secure token-based authentication required
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Control" icon="shield">
    - You own your data completely
    - Files can be deleted at any time
    - Cascade deletion removes all associated data
    - Self-hosted deployment keeps data on your servers
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Processing" icon="brain">
    - File processing uses configured LLM providers (Google Gemini)
    - Extracted data stored in your database only
    - No data shared with third parties
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## File Management

### Viewing Files

All uploaded files are accessible through:
- Chat history with file attachments
- File list in message details
- Direct file URLs (with authentication)

### Deleting Files

<Warning>
Deleting files will also remove all extracted health indicators associated with those files from your health data.
</Warning>

To delete files:
1. Navigate to the message containing the files
2. Select files to delete
3. Confirm deletion

Files and their associated data are permanently removed from:
- Object storage
- Database records
- Health indicator data

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**For Large Files**: Upload PDFs and images work best. Multi-page PDFs are processed in parallel for faster results.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**For Lab Reports**: Upload the full PDF report rather than screenshots for better extraction accuracy.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Add Context**: Include notes with your uploads (e.g., "Annual physical exam 2024") to make them easier to find later.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Organize by Date**: Name files with dates (YYYY-MM-DD format) for better chronological tracking.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="File upload fails" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Solutions**:
    - Check file size (recommend < 50MB per file)
    - Verify authentication token is valid
    - Ensure file type is supported
    - Check server logs for specific errors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No indicators extracted" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify `ENABLE_INDICATOR_EXTRACTION: 1` in config
    - Ensure `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set and valid
    - Check if file contains recognizable health data
    - Try uploading a clearer or higher resolution image
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Processing takes too long" icon="clock">
    **Expectations**:
    - Small files (< 5MB): 10-30 seconds
    - Large PDFs (> 20MB): 1-3 minutes
    - Multi-page documents: Longer but processed in parallel
    
    If processing exceeds these times, check server resources and logs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

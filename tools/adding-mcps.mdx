## Overview

Mirobody Health can connect to external MCP servers, allowing your AI agents to access thousands of additional tools and resources. This enables capabilities like file system access, GitHub integration, database queries, and much more.

<Info>
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to external data sources and tools. Learn more at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).
